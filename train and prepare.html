      <h1>Tips for event day success</h1>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">LAST MINUTE PREPARATION</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Have a good meal the night before event day that is high in carbohydrates and low in fibre. Choose food that you've eaten before a long run in the past. Now is not the time to be trying out new recipes!</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Get your kit ready the day before to avoid rushing around on the morning of the event and pack clothes appropriate for the potential weather conditions. Run in comfortable kit that you have worn during training. This includes everything from your running shoes and socks to your underwear and top. New kit may cause chafing, blisters or general discomfort.</p>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">DON'T RUN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">No matter how nervous you feel before an event, don't run on empty. Toast and jam, cereal with milk or even a banana smoothie will fuel your efforts. Eat at least two hours before your event, to allow time for digestion.</p>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">DON'T OVERDRESS</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">While you don't want to get cold and wet on the start line, avoid the temptation to overdress. Given that most events are in the morning, it's likely that the temperature will rise as the day progresses. </p>

      <h1>HOW TO HYDRATE</h1>

<p>When to drink and what to drink? These concerns preoccupy the thoughts of many a distance runner and it can be baffling to decipher the mixed messages of sports drink manufacturers (who insist we should consume more fluids) and sports scientists (who often encourage us to drink less). Confused? Don’t worry, we spell out the rules of fluid intake as determined by the leading experts.
</p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">MILD HYDRATION CAN BOOST PEFORMANCE</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">A report by New Zealand sport scientists suggested that a 3% drop in body weight through fluid loss doesn’t slow down athletes, while a 2012 paper in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine found that elite runners in the heat of the Dubai Marathon recorded fluid losses of almost 10%, yet still their finishing times were unaffected.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">How is this the case? John Brewer, professor of applied sport science at St Mary’s University, Twickenham, says that “tactical dehydration” is a growing phenomenon among endurance runners, triathletes and cyclists, at club and elite level.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">“Each litre of fluid lost equates to approximately 1kg of body weight,” Brewer explains. “Carrying around less weight has a positive impact on endurance performance, so people train their bodies to cope with dehydration.”</p>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">HOW MUCH FLUID DO YOU NEED?</h5>

<p class="w3-text-grey">Fluid needs are highly individual. In general, for every pound you lose, you need to drink approximately two 10 fl oz glasses (half a litre) of fluids to replace the shortfall.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Checking the quantity and quality of your urine can be used as a guide – dark and scanty urine suggests you need to increase your fluid intake. Remember that your urine will be darker if you take supplements (particularly vitamin C), so volume is a better indicator.</p>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">DON"T PRE-HYDRATE TO EXCESS</h5>

<p class="w3-text-grey">It’s the risk of over-hydration – and potential hyponatremia – that is greater than the risk of dehydration for most. Dr Mitchell Rosner, a kidney specialist from the University of Virginia school of medicine, recently chaired a group of 16 independent experts from four countries to look into the issue.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">“We’ve documented at least 14 deaths (from Exercise Associated Hyponatremia) since 1981,” he says. “The common feature in all cases is excessive water consumption during athletic events. This is driven by misbeliefs that over-hydration can improve performance and even prevent dehydration.”</p>
